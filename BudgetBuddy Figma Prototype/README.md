# BudgetBuddy
A shared-expense tracking application designed to help roommates manage household costs with clarity, fairness, and efficiency.

## Project Description
BudgetBuddy is a budget-tracking app designed specifically for roommates who juggle multiple expenses and want a simple way to manage them. Coordinating expenses such as rent, utilities, internet, food/supplies, and unexpected shared expenses can become chaotic without a proper system in place.

The app provides a centralized, streamlined way for students and young professionals living in shared accommodations to track their expenses, promote transparency, and establish accountability. Features such as automatic cost-splitting allow users to split expenses evenly or in an equitable manner through a customizable expense-splitting feature. Monthly budgeting tips and suggestions further support responsible financial habits among roommates.

Our MVP/vertical slice includes essential features such as an interactive activity feed, a home page with real-time insights, and the ability to add and split expenses swiftly.

## Purpose & Target Users
BudgetBuddy is designed for roommates—particularly students and young professionals—who:  
- Have busy schedules  
- Frequently forget payment deadlines  
- Want to avoid misunderstandings about who owes what  
- Prefer a clean, centralized platform to keep track of their expenses  

## Project Relevance
With the rise in the cost of living, students can no longer afford to be unorganized or risk missing payments, making effective budgeting tools more necessary than ever. Many existing budgeting tools are designed for individual use and do not address the unique challenges of shared living arrangements. Additionally, many roommates rely on informal or manual calculations, which can lead to missed payments, confusion, and unnecessary tension.

This growing financial pressure highlights the need for solutions that simplify shared expense management, reduce the likelihood of missed payments, and support responsible financial habits within shared households. BudgetBuddy offers a structured, transparent solution tailored to the realities of students and young professionals.
